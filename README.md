# daimon, the simplest but powerful and flexible monitoring tool

'daimon' runs a sub-command specified in crontab, compares its output with the standard file(s) under the TASK directory under var/, records the history, and sends out email alert if user specifed so in /etc/daimon.conf if the output is different.

'dm-check' prints summary report or checks the abnormal tasks. User can choose to confirm the status is abnormal or a new normal.

'dm-linux' prints storage usage, CPU load percentage, internal temperature, drive SMART attributes, file changes, directory permissions, LSI raid and Areca raid. It also supports custom commands.

'dm-ups' prints UPS status, it supports two APC UPS models. Feel free to add new models and send me a pull request.

'dm-ssh' is another parallel ssh based on GNU parallel.

We has been using daimon to monitor UPS status and hundreds of Linux machines for a decade. Recently we also use it to monitor LSI raid card in Windows machine.
